	useUncertainty				- use uncertinty model of the camera to determine information matrix in the graph
	fixVertices				- fix all optimized vertices after optimization
  	addFeaturesWhenMapSizeLessThan 			-	we try to add more features if we observe less than features in current frame
  	addFeaturesWhenMeasurementSizeLessThan 	-	we try to add more features if we have less than number of measurements in current frame
  	maxOnceFeatureAdd						- 	we maximally add maxOnceFeatureAdd number of features from one frame
  	minEuclideanDistanceOfFeatures			- 	we skip adding features closer than minEuclideanDistanceOfFeatures (in meters)
  	addNoFeaturesWhenMapSizeGreaterThan		-	we skip adding because we seealready enough features
